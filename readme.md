## Features
* Landing page with Three.js terrain generated randomly with vertices
* I made a circle following the cursor and it indicates wheter you can click something or not
* About Me tab that shows up with an CSS animation, and tell you more about myself
* Projects are build in OOP (Oriented Object Programming) which allows me to had whener I want a project I made in an easy way
* Scroll parallax home made, I wanted something who kind of destroy a bit my project when you scroll so I made it myself, also in OOP
* Loading animation made in OOP and last until images are loaded 
* There is also a scroll indicator on top (as a small bar growing when you scroll) which indicate you where you are basically
* I made some cool buttons that have shadow on their back which give a 3D impression
* I also made a simple 404 page with Three.JS animations on background
